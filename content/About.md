I was born and raised in Orono, Maine. I received my BA in statistics from Harvard in 2019, and went on to obtain my MS in biostatistics from the Harvard School of Public Health in 2021. I'm currently a first year PhD candidate in biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. As lifelong endurance athlete and sports fan, my interests lie at the intersection of public health, human performance, digital technology, and sports science.
